# **Machine Learning Models Android App**

This is an android app created to showcase and test the models that I have created from the project: https://github.com/MichaelShep/SegmentationRecognitionCNN

This project has been created as part of my Third Year Computer Science Project towards my degree at the University of York.

The app is created in Java, making use of the PyTorch mobile library in order to allow us to work with our machine learning models.

To run the app in this project, you will need to have added to the assets folder the attributes, multi and segmentation models that can
be generated by running the code in my main repository listed above.
