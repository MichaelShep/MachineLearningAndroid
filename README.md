# **MachineLearningAndroid**

This is an android app created to showcase and test the models that I have created from the project: https://github.com/MichaelShep/SegmentationRecognitionCNN

This project has been created as part of my Third Year Computer Science Project towards my degree at the University of York.

The app is created in Java, making use of the PyTorch mobile library in order to allow us to work with our machine learning models.
